              <h1> About Me</h1>
<hr>

<div class="container">
<p>My name is Blaine Howitt. I live in Vancouver, Washington. I like basketball, music and my cat Thomas.</p>

<aside><img class="imgA" src="assets/Images/IMG_2925.JPG"></aside>

<p>Now this is a story all about how my life got flipped-turned upside down and I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there, I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air.
  In West Philadelphia, born and raised, on the playground was where I spent most of my days.
  Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
  and all shooting some b-ball outside of the school.
  When a couple of guys, who were up to no good,
  started making trouble in my neighborhood.
  I got in one little fight and my mom got scared.
  She said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air."
  
  I begged and pleaded with her day after day,
  but she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way.
  She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
  I put my Walkman on and said, "I might as well kick it."
  
  First class, yo, this is bad,
  drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.
  Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
  Hmm, this might be alright.
  
  But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that.
  Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?
  I don't think so.
  I'll see when I get there.
  I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air.
  
  Well, the plane landed and when I came out
  there was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out.
  I ain't trying to get arrested yet.
  I just got here.
  I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared.
  
  I whistled for a cab and when it came near
  the license plate said "Fresh" and it had dice in the mirror.
  If anything I could say that this cab was rare,
  but I thought, "Nah, forget it."
  – "Yo, homes to Bel-Air."
  
  I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8
  and I yelled to the cabbie, "Yo homes smell ya later!"
  I looked at my kingdom,
  I was finally there,
  To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air.
